/**
 * sky::array is a container that encapsulates multi-dimensional arrays.
 *
 * Thus struct has the same aggregate type semantics as a C-style array.
 * The size and efficienty of an m-dimensional array,
 * `array<T, N1, N2, ..., Nm>`, is equivalent to the size and efficiency of
 * `T[N1*N2*...*Nm]`.
 * The struct provides the benefits of a standard container, such as knowing its
 * own size, supporting assignment, random access iterators, etc.
 *
 * In the special case where some dimension `Ni == 0`,
 * `array.begin() == array.end()`, which is some unique value.
 * The effect of calling `front()` or `back()` on such an array is undefined.
 *
 * `array` is an aggregate (it has no user-defined constructors and no private
 * or protected members), which allows it to use aggregate-initialization.
